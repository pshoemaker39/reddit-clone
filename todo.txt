Using the reddit clone source code taken from ng-book (up to page 70) add a property to
the article model that is of type string called “role”.

In the existing articles array be sure to instantiate the newly added field for each article by setting the
“role” field to either “user” or “administrator”.

At least one article should be of administrator role.

For each article in the appropriate template include a button element with the button text “flag”.

The button element should only render if the user role is set to administrator.

This can be done using the ngIf directive.


Extra Credit: add (click) event to the button that calls a
component function called flagArticle. The flagArticle function should call a service
function that accepts the article and downvotes the article so that its the lowest voted
article. You can do this by passing the article to the component function or by passing
the array index to the function and then accessing the article using the array index.
